# DeepoDetec

Repository for tensorflow detection for Deepomatic. 

It is a slightly modified version of the [Tensorflow Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/object_detection). The tutorials there apply for this, except _make_tf_record.py_ can be used to create datasets.
Pretrained checkpoints for fine-tuning can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
